#NN implementation of the fruits data set

In this project, a neural network is constructed to learn to classify the images of the fruits data set (https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits). Only four classes of fruits are considered: apples, lemons, oranges and pears. A pretrained CNN is used (MobileNET  https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) with added fully connected layers that we trained.
